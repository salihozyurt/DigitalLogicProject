This project is based on a given project from Digital Logic Design course in Marmara University.<br> Project is preferably demanded to accomplish in groups. Me and my classmate have been coding <br>this project by dividing it into modules and assigning to ourselves.<br>
Project is basically about creating a minimal processor using an assembler language<br>-we chose C for this purpose- and an application for logical gates and complicated <br>computation units -logisim is mandatory-.<br>
For the designing of assembler we aimed three main features in our code:
* __Optimal:__ Designing functions and data structures for each library is carefully accomplished. We aimed for functions which are not limited to the current problem. They are designed to be nearly common.
* __Solid:__ We tested each library in every situation and we find a solution which is never prone to cause errors.
* __Ease of Use:__ Even those who are beginners to Java can understand a great portion of our project. We aimed for utter abstraction. And we believe we succeed it.
